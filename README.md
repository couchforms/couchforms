### Features

- Rest API for integration into existing systems and processes
- Form/Survey customization

### Built With

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io/)

## Getting started

To get the project running locally on your machine you need to have the following development tools installed:

- Node.JS
- Yarn
- PostgreSQL

1. Clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/couchforms/couchforms.git && cd couchforms
```

2. Install Node.JS packages:

```
yarn install
```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.examples` and change it according to your setup. Make sure the `DATABASE_URL` variable is set correctly according to your local database. You must also set the email variables to valid SMTP-credentials for the login to work.

```
cp .env.example .env && nano .env
```

4. Let prisma set up the database for you:

```
npx prisma db push
```

5. Start the development server:

```
yarn dev
```

You can now access the app on [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy couchforms yourself on your own machine is using Docker. This requires Docker and docker-compose on your system to work.

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/couchforms/couchforms.git && cd couchforms
```

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.examples` and change it according to your setup. You must set the email variables to valid SMTP-credentials for the login to work:

```
cp .env.example .env && nano .env
```

Start the docker-compose process to build and spin up the couchforms container as well as the postgres database.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

You can now access the app on [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)
